SimpleForm Protector
=====================

Adds [Protector](https://github.com/inossidabile/protector) support to [SimpleForm](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form) associations.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "protector-simple_form"
```

And then run the following command to install it:

```console
bundle
```

## Usage

### Associations

SimpleForm does a great job at dealing with associations (`f.association` helper) but when used in conjunction with Protector, it will not protect the collection used unless you specify it by hand using the `:collection` option.

This gem will protect the collections that are automatically generated by SimpleForm using the same subject as the object the association belongs to.

In the event where you'd rather not have the automatically generated collection protected, you can set the `:protect` option to `false`.

```erb
<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>
  <%= f.association :company, protect: false %>  # Association scope: `Company.all`
  <%= f.association :roles %>                    # Association scope: `Role.restrict!(@user.protector_subject)`
<% end %>
```
